# GRacer

With XQuartz installed, this game can be run on Mac, Windows, or Linux! Ghost Racer is a 2D racer/shooter game in which the goal is to save as many Lost Souls as possible, while killing the undead. Oh, and also it would be good to try not to crash your car. Last but NOT LEAST, you must avoid human pedestrians at all costs (hardest part of the game). 

From Carey Nachenberg's spec:

Controls:

● Left arrow key or the ‘a’ key: Turns the Ghost Racer steering wheel left

● Right arrow key or the ‘d’ key: Turns the Ghost Racer steering wheel right

● Up arrow key or the ‘w’ key: Speeds the Ghost Racer up

● Down arrow key or the ‘s’ key: Slows the Ghost Racer down

● Space bar: Fires holy water, if Ghost Racer has any left

● The ‘q’ key: Quits the game

● The ‘f’ key: Causes the game to run one tick at a time for debugging


Points are awarded as follows:

● When Ghost Racer disposes of a zombie pedestrian: 150 points

● When Ghost Racer disposes of a zombie cab: 200 points

● When Ghost Racer saves a soul: 100 points

● When Ghost Racer picks up a holy water refill goodie: 50 points

● When Ghost Racer picks up a healing goodie: 250 points

● Bonus points for finishing the level quickly: max of 5000 (goes down as the game
progresses)


MY WORK: 

I wrote the files Actor.h, Actor.cpp, StudentWorld.h, StudentWorld.cpp to implement the various character and world methods necessary for this game to run to the spec assigned to us for UCLA's CS32 project 3. 

There is also a file 'report.docx' in which I detail explanations of notable methods I implemented, as well as design decision I made where the spec was unclear.
